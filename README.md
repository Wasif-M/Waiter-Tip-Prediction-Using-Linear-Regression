# Waiter-Tip-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

Waiter-Tip-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression is a machine learning project that predicts the tip amount a waiter is likely to receive based on the total bill amount, gender, and other relevant features.

This project uses Linear Regression, a statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The dataset used in this project contains information about the total bill amount, tip amount, tip percentage, gender of the person who paid the bill, whether the party was smoking or non-smoking, and the day and time of the meal.
